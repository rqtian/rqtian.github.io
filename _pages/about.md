<!-- ## Bio -->

I am a postdoc researcher in [High-performance Computing group](https://hpc.pnnl.gov/index.shtml) of [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/), mentored by [Dr. Gokcen Kestor]  
<!-- in I am a final year Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/index.php) at [College of William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/), advised by Dr. [Bin Ren](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~bren/). Currently, I am having an internship in (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KkMYGc0AAAAJ&hl=en). -->

## Research Interest

Compiler support for parallel computing and security improvement:

- High-performance compiler construction (with MLIR);
- Compiler static analysis and code transformation (with LLVM);
- Runtime optimization.
