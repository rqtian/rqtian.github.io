<!-- ## Bio -->

I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/index.php), [College of William and Mary](https://www.wm.edu/). I am luckily advised by Dr. [Bin Ren](http://www.cs.wm.edu/~bren/). Currently, I am having an internship in [High-performance Computing group](https://hpc.pnnl.gov/index.shtml) of [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/), luckily mentored by [Dr. Gokcen Kestor](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KkMYGc0AAAAJ&hl=en).

## Research Interest
- Compiler support for parallel computing and security improvement;
- Compiler static analysis and code transformation (with LLVM);
- Runtime optimization
